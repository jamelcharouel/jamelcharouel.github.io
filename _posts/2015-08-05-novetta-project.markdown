I'm just going to preface this blog post by saying I'm sort of limited in what I'm allowed to show/say, unfortunately. This app that I created over my 4 month internship was super cool, and I wish I could discuss it in major detail, but here goes.

This summer I interned for a company by the name of Novetta Solutions, LLC (just Novetta, for short). I worked on the mobile development team with another intern to develop an app from scratch that would allow the user to view a building environment, both indoor and outdoor. The user could import and view 3D models, floor-plans, and other media associated with the building all together in one space. All they needed to do was simply tag a building in the google maps view, and they would be taken to the outdoor/indoor views from there. This allows the user to understand relationships between their specific location and the media that they import. By being given the ability to insert and take their own media (along with a 3D model for visual reference), the user can easily "move" around the building through the app without needing to even be on site. Floor-plans give them an idea of 2D space (along with the images they take), and each gallery of photos is associated with the floor so that nothing gets mixed up.

The "formal" description of the position and what it entailed can be seen below (also seen on my linkedin page under the about tab):

Took whiteboard ideas through the research, design, development, and marketing phases to create an Android application for indoor and outdoor building perspectives and image aggregation. The application allowed a user to view a 3D rendering of the building as well as import respective floor-plans. The user could also take photos that were associated with either the outdoor view or an indoor floorplan. This allowed the user to easily visualize the geospatial relationships among images.

The application was developed for Android version 4.2+ and used Google maps and other libraries such as Otto for event broadcasting/subscribing, Picasso for image loading, and Rajawali for 3D model rendering. The development methodology was Agile based using Atlassian Jira boards and Bitbucket with git for version control.

Learned about various Android framework components and design patterns such as activities, fragments, application database structure, intents, threads, publish/subscribe pattern, file IO, activity/fragment lifecycle, using adb to view, push, and pull files, testing with the Genymotion emulator and actual devices of various sizes, material design, and Android UI/UX methodologies.
