It's been a while since my last post on my site, but I'm back. Lately I've been messing around with PHP, HTML, and some more SQL. I created a webpage akin to doodle poll (albeit much less nice looking), that utilized SQL to allow users to log in and create their schedules as well as send schedules to other users via email. The ones creating the schedules were called "Makers" whereas users without a proper account setup were called users. With the power of cookies and sessions, users still had the ability to view and edit the schedules sent to them, but could not create schedules themselves. A screenshot of the (not pretty but functional) schedule can be seen below:

There is also source code on my github page, although the scheduling looks a little different since I messed around with it. As a side note, I've also been looking into Kali Linux and what fun things I can do with that. Once I have it up and running on my PC (the Live USB boot isn't launching correctly at the moment) I'll make a post about it.
