	I haven't been updating this site as frequently as I wanted to when I first created it (mostly due to school commitments at first, and then due to being busy ramping up for work/enjoying my last few weeks of freedom before becoming a 'real adult'). Seeing as my last post was almost exactly a year ago, I'll spend this post recapping my fourth year up to starting my employment. I'm going to start to try and update this website more frequently than I have in the past, whether with personal updates or professional ones. Not having homework helps a lot with that. 

	My last year at school was a mix of a lot of work and a lot of much needd leisure time. I found myself making comparisons to senior year of high school, where most of the work was frontloaded due to worrying about getting into college, only this time there was a worry about finding a job before graduation. I blocked out a lot of time during job hunt season (Fall-ish to early Winter for most of us CS people at UVA) to prep for interviews, whether this was studying code or going through the basics of how to sell myself to a manager. There was about a three week period where I had an interview a day, or even two interviews a day. All in all, the experience was exhausting, but I found myself coming out of it with more than a few job offers under my belt. With that done, I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders. It was like getting into college all over again, because I didn't have the extra work of worrying about where my next big step in life would take me.

	I spent the rest of my fourth year at UVA enjoying the company of my friends, eating out, and enjoying the town (City?) of Charlottesville like I never could with the amount of school work I normally had. While I want to say that I used the majority of my free time to work on some large personal project or gain a specialty in a new technology, I didn't do that (although I did build a really simple Alexa app, coming to the Alexa store once I make a few changes to it). It's totally OK sometimes to completely remove yourself from programming and enjoy the other aspects of life that make you happy. I've read far too many stories on Reddit's /r/cscareerquestions discussing how a student or a professional burnt out because they spent their time at school or work programming, and then went home and spent their free time also programming, every single day. Don't get me wrong, I really really like programming, solving problems and pretending that I'm a wizard because I'm typing some words into a terminal. Taking a break to enjoy the other aspects of life, however, is important to your health too, just as much as going to the gym and eating properly. 

	In other news, graduating hasn't honestly changed much of how I operate my life. I'm living at home to save money because rent, at the moment, is a trashcan in which you get the opportunity to throw away your hard earned cash. A majority of my friends from home are still finishing up school, so I'll still have them around for at least another year. My friends from school are either around DC or New York City, so at least on the east coast. So yeah, not much has changed there. I've taken an interest in investing now that I've got a consistent source of income that isn't a summer internship. Robinhood, ETF's, DGAZ are some terms and acronyms I remember. Overall, life is more or less the same, except there isn't any homework, which is awesome.
