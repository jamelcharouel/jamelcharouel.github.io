I'm creating this website for putting my thoughts down and showing off the cool stuff I do, whether its for school or otherwise. It's being hosted by github pages and created utilizing jekyll, a simple text-to-static website software.

You can always check out the bottom header bar for my email, github site, and personal twitter page (although I don't tweet too often).

For more info on jekyll, check out this [link][jekyll].
