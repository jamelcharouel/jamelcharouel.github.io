title:  "What Is This Site For?"
---

I'm creating this website for putting my thoughts down and showing off the cool stuff I do, whether its for school or otherwise. It's being hosted by github pages and created utilizing jekyll, a simple text-to-static website software.

You can always check out the bottom header bar for my email, github site, and LinkedIn profile.
