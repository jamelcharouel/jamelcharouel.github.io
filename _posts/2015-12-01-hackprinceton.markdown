A few weeks ago I went to HackPrinceton with three friends (our first hackathon ever). 36 hours of sweat, blood, and tears and we came up with a working project which can be seen at https://github.com/LProcopi15/HackPrinceton. While we didn't win anything and while we felt like death the day after (from lack of sleep and nutrition, they fed us fast food for breakfast, lunch, dinner and fourth meal), we (or at least I) had a good time creating the web application that may one day help save a few lives -- DESIGNATED. The general idea is that a friend can use the application to Designate themselves as the designated driver for the night. An invitiation via email is sent out after the Designated Driver picks friends, a time, and location for the event. Friends that are going and who will be drinking will respond to the email via the link, and will automatically receive another link. This link gives them the option to tip their DD friend (either through Venmo or Bitcoin) for taking one for the team that night. The DD friend would also be able to view restaurants in the local area that would give them deals on food or non-alcoholic drinks for being the DD for the night. Since we only had 36 hours to develop the application and were in uncharted territory AKA Princeton, New Jersey, we didn't actually get any restaurants in on the web application before the deadline, but the proof of concept was added. This was the general idea of the web application, with some other features including allowing users to log in to their accounts to keep their friend's list specific to them as well as automatically generating QR codes for their bitcoin wallet to get paid. A screenshot of the landing/login can be seen below. To view more info on the web application or see more screenshots, check out this devpost link: http://devpost.com/software/hackprinceton-pg27se. You can always run the application on your own server from the Github link above, just make sure to change around your database password.
