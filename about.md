Hi!

My name is Jamel Charouel. I'm currently a rising third year/junior at the University of Virginia, studying to get my B.S. in Computer Science.  The main languages I know are Java and C++, but I'm familiar with some others that I've used on my own or a little bit in courses I've taken. I'm also quite familiar with the Android SDK and have developed a couple apps, for school and work. If you want more information on my professional background, you can find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jamel-charouel/a2/739/892).

As for my hobbies/non-professional stuff about me, I like to spend my time exercising at the gym, playing video games, coding up random one-off projects, and watching plot-driven TV shows (except for its always sunny, that show is great).
