  Hey! This is my personal website for projects and other random stuff I think to throw on here. It's very much still a work in progress. I'm using github pages to host it and jekyll for setting everything up and making it look pretty.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
link_home: "<a href='http://home.com/'>Home</a>"
url: "http://jcharouel.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
